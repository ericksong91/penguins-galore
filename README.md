# Penguins Galore!

## Description

This simple application is designed to demonstrate a basic Single Page Application (SPA) using the React JS library. The data used for this project was taken from the Wikipedia page for [penguins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin). The site features several components such as a navigation bar, ability to view penguins from a database and the ability to add new penguins. You can also "Like" penguins and the change will persist through reloads.

## Usage

1. Open the App and you will be greeted by a home page

2. Clicking on 'Click Here to See Penguins!' or the center image will take you to a list of penguins.

3. Clicking on 'Like?' will allow the user to like a penguin and Vise Versa. 

4. Clicking on 'More Details' or the image of the corresponding penguin will take you to a description page.

5. The description page has a short description about the penguin as well as its scientific/latin name.

6. Clicking the image or 'Return to Penguins' will take you back to the list of penguins. Clicking on 'Like?' will allow you to like the penguin and Vise Versa.

7. Clicking on 'Add New Penguin' at the top of the list of penguins will allow you to add a new penguin. The user is able to enter the name, the scientific/latin name, a short 200 character description of the penguin and finally an image URL of the penguin.

8. Clicking 'Hide' will hide the form from the user again.

9. The navigation bar above will take you back to the homepage, the penguins list, or the about me page for the app author.
